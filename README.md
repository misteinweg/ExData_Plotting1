## Instructions

Please take into account my R is in Spanish, this means some graphs will have days printed in Spanish. (Instead of "Thu", "Fri", "Sat" it will have its spanish equivalent "Jue", "Vie" "Sab")

The forked repo contains a folder called "R scripts - Plots" that contains:
-4 R scripts to plot the graphs
-4 png files with the plotted graphs
