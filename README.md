## ExData Course Project 1

Please take into account my R is in Spanish, this means some graphs will have days displayed in Spanish. (Instead of "Thu", "Fri", "Sat" it will have its spanish equivalent "Jue", "Vie" "Sab")

The forked repo has a folder called "R scripts - Plots" that contains:
- 4 R scripts to plot the graphs
- 4 png files with the plotted graphs
